## Exit Command

### Description

The exit command does exactly what its name suggests: it allows you to end a shell session and, in most cases, automatically closes the terminal youâ€™re using.

### Usage

To end your current shell session and close the terminal, simply type:

```bash
exit
```

This command efficiently terminates your session and gracefully exits the terminal.
